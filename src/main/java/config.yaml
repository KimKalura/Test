      My background is related to the humanities side, more precisely to translations.
      I have a passion for web development and curiosity laid me to this 'coding world'. I am open for any opportunity to be a back-end programmer developer, with different technologies.

      I am currently developing an application for learning and practicing a foreign language. The purpose is an educational one, of online cultural exchange, where polyglots and lovers of fiction and writing short prose/poetry will be able to interact.
